# Note-manager
This is a short project which helps you in managing your notes, creating new notes, managing pre-existing notes, viewing and searching notes from your directories. 
It works by creating 3 functions, one to create a new note where you can type out the title for the note and the content for the note. 
Then we have a second function to view notes whch are saved in a directory in your system, so you can see the titles and see if you vish to open any of them.
The thrid function helps us in searching for our notes and reading them based on specific keywords present inside the note that you typed in. 

The future scoppe for this project isnt much other than some GUI integrations, since as of now it only works in the terminal window of your coding platform or in you powershell terminal for WSL. Some more future improvements include better and more efficient keyword or hotword search, integrating some LLM API's to make the search process faster, efficient and accurate.
